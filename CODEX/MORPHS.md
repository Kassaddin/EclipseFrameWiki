[The morphs](https://eclipsephase.github.io/en/04/21-morphs.html#morphs) here represent a fraction of the sleeves and shells available to characters. You must purchase at least one morph during [character creation](https://eclipsephase.github.io/en/04/01-character-stats.html). During gameplay, you may need to acquire a new morph when forking, egocasting, or resleeving ([Acquiring Morphs](https://eclipsephase.github.io/en/15/03-acquiring-morphs.html)) — or when the one you have is destroyed.

- **Movement Rate:** The mobility system used and distance covered ([Movement](https://eclipsephase.github.io/en/12/24-movement.html)).
- **Ware:** Bioware, cyberware, hardware, meshware, and/or nanoware the morph is equipped with ([starting on Gear](https://eclipsephase.github.io/en/16/05-common-tech-and-ware.html)).
- **Morph Traits:** Traits that each morph of this type has ([Traits](https://eclipsephase.github.io/en/04/28-traits.html)).
- **Common Extras:** Prevalent but not baseline traits or ware for the morph type. These are not included in the MP cost and must be acquired separately.
